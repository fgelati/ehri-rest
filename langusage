Dear all,
I am writing about the EAD-level langusage. When a EAD file is ingested where this piece of information is absent, the portal takes langusage=ENG as default value.
Would it be possible to modify it? I am striving with EADs from Italy and France with no langusage, but written in ITA and FRE.
I might suggest such a parameter:

if an EAD is ingested in Italy and has no langusage, default langusage will be ITA;
if an EAD is ingested in France and has no langusage, default langusage will be FRA;
if an EAD is ingested in the Netherlands and has no langusage, default langusage will be DUT

Another option would be, to allow the langusage to be chosen explicitly at ingest time. However, we have to make sure that this parameter appears both in the user-interface ingest button, and in the ingest tool.
Also, what if we simply write in the property file

"FRE"=languageCode ?
